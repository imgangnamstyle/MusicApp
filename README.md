# MusicApp
This Music application website was created for an assignment submission for the WEB222 class. 
The outcome of this assignment was to learn the Document Object Model(DOM), how to update CSS using DOM, and the CSS BOX model.
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used in this assignment.

This website features a list of songs in the .json format.
The lists of three artists' songs were listed on the website which displays a list of songs with information including song title, released year, and an image for each song by clicking the artist button. Clicking the image of the song opens a new tab playing the song on YouTube.

Clicking the request button on the left bar menu shows the requesting page including the artist name, music genre, artist URLs, song URLs, description, submit button, and add button.
